      <h1> About Me!</h1>
      <div class = "myacademics">
        <p> I'm currently a second-year student at the University of Michigan’s School of Information. Before being admitted to the BSI program, I was enrolled in LSA Honors where I took courses in psychology, statistics, data oriented programming, web development, and digital product design. Although I have a wide range of professional interests, I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology and human behavior. In my free time, I like to keep up with current events, watch sports and Netflix, and read science fiction books.</p><br>
        <p> I was born in Jackson, Michigan but moved to Potterville, Michigan, and graduated from Potterville High School in 2019. When I was in high school, my favorite classes were chemistry, philosophy, and geometry, however I found a particular interest in Java programming during my senior year when I took APCS.</p><br>
        <p> This summer, I will be working at Quicken Loans as a UX Design intern, and I am currently searching for a Summer 2022 internship in design, consulting, or product management. I have become increasingly interested in startups and consumer technology. Some of my skills include user research, strategy, empathizing, prototyping, design thinking, and project management.
