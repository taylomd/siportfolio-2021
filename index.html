    <p> Hi, I'm Dane Taylor. I’m a sophomore at the University of Michigan. I created this website to act as a showcase for my creative work so far in high school and college, so recruiters can look at a portfolio during the hiring process! I have experience with photography, photo editing, and user experience design and would like a job in any of these fields.
