    <p> Hi, I'm Dane Taylor. I’m a sophomore at the University of Michigan. I created this website to act as a showcase for my creative work so far in high school and college, so recruiters can look at a portfolio during the hiring process! I have experience with photography, photo editing, and user experience design and would like a job in any of these fields.

		  <p><i>Top Left:</i> This was a photo taken on my iPhone in early 2020. The photo was taken at an unknown park in Warren, Michigan. Eventually I also edited the photo in Photoshop once I learned how to use it.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id = "desc_two"></a>
		  <p><i>Top Middle:</i> This was a website redesign I was working on. Alongside a remote team, I created a working food delivery app prototype in Figma. We created the branding and design strategy to align our goals related to our research, including personas, usability metrics, and user journeys.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id = "desc_three"></a>
		  <p> <i>Top Right:</i> This was a photo taken on my iPhone in summer 2020. The photo was taken at Golden Coast Dr. In Chicago, IL. Eventually I also edited the photo in Photoshop once I learned how to use it.</p> 
		  <br>
		<a id = "desc_four"></a>
		  <p> <i>Center Left:</i> For my internship, I worked with a global remote team alongside a digital marketing team to serve Greenpop's digital presence in the NGO industry. Their goal was to spread awareness of the Eden festival of action event and improve sign-up usability. We assessed the functionality of the sign-up via user research and testing to deliver strategic recommendations and offer a solution mock-up.</p>  
		  <br>
		<a id = "desc_five"></a>
		  <p><i>Center Middle:</i> This was a photo taken on my iPhone in late 2020. The photo was taken at a lakehouse somewhere Up North in Michigan. Eventually I also edited the photo in Photoshop once I learned how to use it.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id= "desc_six"></a>
		  <p> <i>Center Right:</i> This was a photo taken on my iPhone in early 2020. The photo was at the Burton Memorial Tower on Michigan’s campus. Eventually I also edited the photo in Photoshop once I learned how to use it. I really like this photo because the Burton memorial tower is one of the coolest buildings on campus in my opinion.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id= "desc_seven"></a>
		  <p> <i>Bottom Left:</i> This was a photo taken on my friend’s iPhone in late 2020. The photo was taken during a vacation while my friends and I were up north. Eventually I also edited the photo in VSCO to make the background black and white. This is one of my favorite photos because it was a very fun weekend with my friends during MSU/Michigan halloween weekend last fall.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id= "desc_eight"></a>
		  <p> <i>Bottom Middle:</i> This was a photo taken on my iPhone in late 2018. The photo was taken during one of the last football games of the year during my senior year of high school. Eventually I also edited the photo in VSCO. This is also one of my favorite photos because it reminds me of my hometown.</p>
		  <br>
		<a id= "desc_nine"></a>
		  <p> <i>Bottom Right:</i> This was a personal project I worked on for a design class. The app is called Travelmate, and it is meant to appeal to young travelers who are “adventurers” want a sense of community while they travel. It is the first full design project I completed on my own!</p>
